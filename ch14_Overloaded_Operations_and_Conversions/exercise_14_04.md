# Exercise 14.04
> Explain how to decide whether the following should be class members:
   - // a: %
     - symmetric, non-members
   - // b: %=
     - change state, members
   - // c: ++
     - change state, members
   - // d: ->
     - must be member
   - // e: <<
     - non-members
   - // f: &&
     - don't overload (short-circuit evaluation not keep)
   - // g: ==
     - symmetric, non-members
   - // h: ()
     - must be member
