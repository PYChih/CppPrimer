The state of the art in machine learning (ML) 
has achieved exceptional accuracy on many computer 
vision tasks solely by training models on photos. 
Building upon these successes and advancing 3D object 
understanding has great potential to power a wider range 
of applications, such as augmented reality, robotics, 
autonomy, and image retrieval. For example, earlier 
this year we released MediaPipe Objectron,
 a set of real-time 3D object detection models 
 designed for mobile devices, which were trained 
 on a fully annotated, real-world 3D dataset, 
 that can predict objectsâ€™ 3D bounding boxes.
